# CSC211H-Honors-Project

My project aims to address the issue of clothing waste by enabling consumers to track their clothing purchases and the clothes they own, so that people can recognize how much they are spending on clothing, cut down on consumption, encourage reuse and recycle, and help save the planet.

This application is developed by Jingjing Ye, under the supervision of Dr. Azhar as the honor's project for the course CSC211H Advanced Programming Techniques.
